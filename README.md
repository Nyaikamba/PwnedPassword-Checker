# Pwned Password Checker

Pwnded Password Checker checks passwords to see if they have previously been breached or exposed using the API from [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)

* Ideally, for safety and security reasons it is best to be the most skeptical about checking your password online. This checker provides a more secure method of doing so.

##Usage
* This can be run on the command line terminal by feeding in the password(s) you would like to check
* Multiple passwords can be checked at the same time
* The results show you if your password has been breached before as well as a count.
